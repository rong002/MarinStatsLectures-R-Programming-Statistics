# MarinStatsLectures-R-Programming-Statistics

trying to learn R, RNotebook, Stats, using the cloud version of the Rstudio; and, at the same time practice writing in 'markdown'.  In addition, prepare the material for writing my own book 'RM: the machine learning perspective'.

the Merin Stats lectures are each stored in separate Notebook.

On the first trial I failed to include an image into the notebook and found out that on changing to a new project in RSCloud, I need to do the 'git config --global' all over again!
